Asynchronous programming is fundamental in Node.js,
ensuring non-blocking operations. 
Promises and async/await are two key techniques
for managing asynchronous code, each with distinct syntax.


Promises use .then() and .catch() for
handling asynchronous operations and chaining, 
while async/await provides a more readable, 
synchronous-like syntax for managing 
asynchronous code with try/catch for error handling.
