The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for
 making HTTP requests and processing the responses.


Fetch is the modern replacement for 
XMLHttpRequest: unlike XMLHttpRequest, which uses callbacks,
Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the
 modern web such as service workers and 
 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).


With the Fetch API, you make a request by calling fetch(),
 which is available as a global function in both window and
  worker contexts.
You pass it a Request object or a string containing the URL 
to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request.


The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled
 with a Response object representing the server's response. 
 You can then check the request status and extract 
 the body of the response in various formats, including text 
and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.

fetch() makes a GET request, but you can 
use the method option to use a different request method.
