An API, or Application Programming Interface, 
is like a bridge that allows two different software systems 
to communicate with each other.

It defines a set of rules and protocols for 
requesting and exchanging data.


APIs can be used to retrieve information from external 
sources, send data to external services, or perform 
various other actions. 

They are widely used in web development to access 
data from various online services such as social media 
platforms, weather data, financial information, and more.

To make API requests in JavaScript, you 
can use the fetch API, which is built into
modern browsers. It is a promise-based API 
that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and 
handle responses asynchronously.
